Scripts and functions used for data analysis in the paper by Zanin et al 2020 
The scripts and functions should be generally executed in numerical order. 
Shell scripts are used to run th eR function with the correct parameters.
We do not provide them as a pipeline expected to work smoothly (although it should!), 
but rather as a reference to inspect the method and eventually copy the parts that you find useful for your own work.
Comments welcome!
